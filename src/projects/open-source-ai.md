## Project Overview

This project is grounded in Nikko's long experience working in open source communities and building open source software, as well as the decades of scholarship about the ways that open source software can empower commmunities.  As community technology needs evolve and AI systems dominate technical infrastructure, open source AI seems like an obvious natural extension of open source software for community benefit. However, open source software paradigms don't seem to fit for many AI-based projects and many leading scholars treat AI as though it is completely distinct from software.  If AI is not software, what kinds of open source communities might we create and sustain around it?

## Research Questions

- How, fundamentally, is AI distinct from software?
- Given that difference, what kinds of open source/community governance models might AI's unique properties require?
- What levels of openness (open weight, open data set, open source code) are most beneficial to community control over models?

## Methodology

#### Archival and Original Source/Code Research
We are gathering sources describing the early foundations of open source software and their engagements with early AI/ML systems. These documents include early computing history magazines, technical reports, internal communications, and, where available, source code.

#### Theoretical Research
In addition to research into the ideologies and governance of open source communities and software, we are also exploring the theoretical and philsophical distinctions between software and AI.  

#### Community Participation & Ethnography
We are joining and contribute to several open source AI communities, each considering different forms of openness.
