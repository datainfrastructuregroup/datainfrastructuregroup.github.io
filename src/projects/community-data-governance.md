## Project Overview

This project explores how communities can take ownership of data governance decisions that affect them. We work with local organizations to design and implement participatory processes for data collection, analysis, and sharing. Our approach combines ethnographic research with the development of digital tools that support collective decision-making about data use and privacy.

## Research Questions

- How can communities develop their own data governance protocols that reflect their values and priorities?
- What tools and processes best support collective decision-making about data privacy and sharing?
- How do power dynamics within communities affect data governance decisions?

## Methodology

Our approach combines:

### Participatory Design
We work directly with community organizations to co-design data governance frameworks that meet their specific needs and contexts.

### Ethnographic Research
Through participant observation and interviews, we study how communities currently make decisions about data and what challenges they face.

### Tool Development
We build and test digital platforms that support community data governance, including consent management systems and collective decision-making tools.

## Current Status

We are currently in the second year of this project, working with three community organizations to pilot our governance frameworks. Initial findings suggest that communities want more control over their data but need accessible tools and clear processes to exercise that control effectively.

## Impact

This work contributes to both academic understanding of data governance and practical tools that communities can use to protect their interests in an increasingly data-driven world.
