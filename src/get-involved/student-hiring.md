  DIG is currently hiring Smith students for the 2025-2026 academic year for both our computational and our qualitative projects.

  <li>interested in building or taking apart software systems</li>
  <li>eager to do community-engaged research</li>
  <li>ready to build your professional and academic portfolio</li>
</ul>

... then you might be a good fit for the lab! 

We're currently seeking students with either strong computational skills or strong writing and research skills.  

Our computational projects use Python, SQL, and frequently a modern Javascript library (or framework like Nodejs).  Our research projects involve extensive reading, writing, and qualitative analysis of original documents.  

In all cases, students will have ample opportunity publish or present their work.
