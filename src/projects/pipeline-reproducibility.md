## Project Overview

Many community organizations struggle with data processing workflows that are difficult to reproduce, update, or share. This project develops containerized, well-documented data processing pipelines that can run on modest hardware and be maintained by staff with limited technical training. We focus on common nonprofit use cases like program evaluation, grant reporting, and advocacy research.

## The Problem

Community organizations often face several challenges with their data workflows:

- **Inconsistent environments**: Different computers, operating systems, and software versions
- **Undocumented processes**: Knowledge trapped in individual staff members' heads
- **Resource constraints**: Limited budget for expensive software or technical training
- **Staff turnover**: Difficulty maintaining institutional knowledge

## Our Solution

We're developing a toolkit that includes:

### Containerized Workflows
Using Docker containers to ensure consistent execution environments across different machines and operating systems.

### Accessible Documentation
Plain-language documentation that explains both the technical implementation and the analytical choices behind each step.

### Modular Components
Reusable pipeline components that can be combined for different types of analyses.

### Training Materials
Workshops and guides that help organization staff understand and maintain their data workflows.

## Technical Approach

Our pipelines are built using:

- **Python** for data processing and analysis
- **Docker** for containerization and reproducibility
- **Jupyter notebooks** for interactive exploration and documentation
- **GitHub Actions** for automated testing and deployment

## Partner Organizations

We're working with three local nonprofits that represent different use cases:

1. **Youth development organization**: Program evaluation and outcome tracking
2. **Housing advocacy group**: Policy research and data visualization
3. **Environmental justice organization**: Community health data analysis

## Outcomes

By the end of this project, our partner organizations will have:

- Fully documented, reproducible data processing workflows
- Training materials for staff to maintain and update analyses
- Template pipelines that can be adapted for new projects
- Increased confidence in their data analysis capabilities

## Broader Impact

This work demonstrates how academic research can directly benefit community organizations while contributing to scholarly understanding of reproducible research practices in resource-constrained environments.
