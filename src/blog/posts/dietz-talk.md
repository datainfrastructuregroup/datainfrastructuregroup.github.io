## Talk Details

**Date:** September 24, 2025  
**Time:** 12:15 PM - 1:10 PM  
**Location:**  Sabin-Reed 301 @ Smith College  

## Abstract

The government uses sex data in research and policy. But historically, even its scientific bodies havenâ€™t defined sex very clearly. Recent laws excluding trans people and executive orders about gender use scientific language to justify new definitions while clearly working to exclude trans people from public life. This talk asks: how can we do rigorous science that involves sex data and avoid perpetuating injustice?
