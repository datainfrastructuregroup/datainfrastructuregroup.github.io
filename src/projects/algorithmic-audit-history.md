## Project Overview

This archival research project examines how algorithmic auditing practices have evolved over the past two decades, with particular attention to the role of community organizing and advocacy in shaping accountability mechanisms. We analyze policy documents, court cases, advocacy campaigns, and academic literature to understand how different stakeholders have defined algorithmic harm and proposed remedies.

## Research Questions

- How have definitions of algorithmic harm evolved over time?
- What role have grassroots advocacy organizations played in shaping algorithmic accountability practices?
- How do different stakeholders (advocates, researchers, policymakers, industry) frame the problems and solutions differently?
- What can the history of algorithmic auditing teach us about effective accountability mechanisms?

## Methodology

### Archival Research
We are systematically collecting and analyzing documents from multiple sources:

- **Policy documents**: Government reports, legislative hearings, regulatory guidance
- **Legal materials**: Court cases, legal briefs, settlement agreements
- **Advocacy materials**: Campaign documents, reports, public statements
- **Academic literature**: Research papers, conference proceedings, technical reports

### Discourse Analysis
We use qualitative coding methods to identify patterns in how different actors frame algorithmic problems and solutions over time.

### Timeline Construction
We're building a comprehensive timeline of key events, publications, and policy developments in algorithmic accountability.

## Key Themes

Our preliminary analysis has identified several important themes:

### Evolution of Harm Definitions
Early concerns focused primarily on statistical bias, while more recent work emphasizes broader questions of power, participation, and structural inequality.

### Role of Advocacy Organizations
Community organizations have been crucial in identifying real-world harms and pushing for accountability measures that go beyond technical fixes.

### Tension Between Technical and Social Solutions
There's an ongoing tension between approaches that focus on improving algorithms versus approaches that question the use of algorithmic systems altogether.

## Historical Periods

We've identified several distinct periods in the evolution of algorithmic accountability:

1. **Early awareness (2000-2010)**: Initial recognition of algorithmic bias in specific domains
2. **Technical solutions focus (2010-2016)**: Emphasis on fairness metrics and bias detection
3. **Broadening critique (2016-2020)**: Expansion to consider power, participation, and structural issues
4. **Policy engagement (2020-present)**: Increased focus on regulation and governance

## Significance

This historical analysis provides crucial context for current debates about algorithmic accountability. By understanding how we got to the current moment, we can better evaluate proposed solutions and identify promising directions for future work.

## Outputs

This project will produce:

- A comprehensive timeline of algorithmic accountability developments
- Academic papers analyzing key themes and transitions
- Policy recommendations based on historical lessons
- Public-facing materials for advocacy organizations
