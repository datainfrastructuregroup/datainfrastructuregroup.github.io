Excited to share that our paper "Beyond Consent: Toward Community-Driven Data Governance in Sociotechnical Systems" has been accepted to CHI 2025!

## Abstract

Current data governance models rely heavily on individual consent mechanisms that fail to account for collective impacts and community values. We present a framework for community-driven data governance that centers collective decision-making and ongoing accountability.

## Key Contributions

- A participatory design methodology for developing community data governance protocols
- Case studies from three community partnerships
- Design principles for tools that support collective data stewardship

The presentation will be on **May 15th at 2:30 PM** in the "Data and Society" session. Looking forward to the discussions and feedback from the CHI community.

*Pre-print available soon on our publications page.*
