We're thrilled to highlight the excellent work of undergraduate researcher Alex Johnson, who has been investigating reproducibility challenges in data processing pipelines.

## The Problem

Many data science projects fail to reproduce their results due to inconsistent data processing steps, version conflicts, and undocumented dependencies. Alex's research focuses on how these technical issues disproportionately affect community-based research projects with limited technical infrastructure.

## Alex's Approach

Working with local nonprofit organizations, Alex developed a lightweight framework for documenting and containerizing data processing workflows. The approach emphasizes:

- **Accessible documentation** written for non-technical stakeholders
- **Minimal technical dependencies** that work on older hardware
- **Community ownership** of the processing pipeline

## Impact

Three partner organizations have successfully implemented Alex's framework, improving their ability to update analyses and share methods with peer organizations.

Alex will be presenting this work at the upcoming Regional Undergraduate Research Symposium. Congratulations on this important contribution to making data science more accessible and reliable!
