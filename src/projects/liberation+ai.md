## Project Overview

The Liberation + AI Think Tank was founded by Nikko and Catherine D'Ignazio in 2024.  The think tank has grown into a large and thriving community of researchers, programmers, and community members who are thinking critically about AI and what role (if any) AI can play in community liberation.
